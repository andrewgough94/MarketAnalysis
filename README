Stock Evaluation Methodology:

Individual Stock Data
Q4: Best month performance
-Based on largest price increase from beginning of end to the month

Q5: Stock Ratings
- In order to rate a stock we used SQL queries to obtain a current price, a 50 day, and 200 day average price for a given security.
- If the current price is above both the 50 day avg, and 200 day avg, stock is inflated: sell
- If the current price is below the 50 day avg, and above the 200 day avg, stock is stable: hold
- If the current price is below the 200 day avg, and above the 50 day avg, stock has momentum: buy
- If the current price is below the 200 day avg, and below the 50 day avg, stock is falling: sell

Q6: Stock Rating Evaluation
- Using the current rating date price, and the price 3 months in the future, we obtained a % change in stock price.
- If rating is a buy:
    - And if % change > -2%
        - rating is correct
    - else
        - rating is incorrect
- If rating is a hold
    - And if % change > -3% AND % change < +3%
        - rating is correct
    - else
        - rating is incorrect
- If rating is a sell
    - And if % change < +2%
        - rating is correct
    - else
        - rating is incorrect
